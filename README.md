# an 8-bit microcomputer simulator
epic and very cool CPU simulator - My best Project yet
this program simulates an 8 bit microcomputer (down to the CPU registers), I also included some handy scripts for compilation
(I wrote this with ncurses and other gcc stuff, so I don't expect it to compile outside of unix systems, though I haven't tested it)
